No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to

It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked

Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Set my heart on fire, I needed something

You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Father's eyes, but mother's daughter

Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something

I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know

'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked

This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

For all of time, now I know

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know

'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Set my heart on fire, I needed something

It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something

I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and meNo one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know

No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I
